# IconsForMint
I'll publish here some icons for Linux Mint and a free template so you can create your own. Free to use for everyone.

The free template can be opened usign GIMP. It comes with an icon inside as an example.
The icon to be used must first be designed and made square with the proper fillet to fit inside the template.
Every icon might be different so this first process isn't automatized in the template. 
If anyone knows a way to integrate it, feel free to contact me!

List of icons i have created so far:
-Matlab
-Simplex
