# IconsForMint
I'll publish here some icons for Linux Mint and a free template so you can create your own. Free to use for everyone.

The free template can be opened usign GIMP. It comes with an icon inside as an example.
The icon to be used must first be designed and made square with the proper fillet to fit inside the template. You can do this with the reference GIMP file.

List of icons i have created so far:
-Matlab
-Simplex
-Apple Notes
